Then i created a Todo on the NavMenu.razor
I Design and implement an intuitive user interface for the TODO List application using Blazor components
I Include necessary input fields, buttons, and lists to handle task management operations.
I then Applied  suitable styling and layout to enhance the user experience.
I Implement functionality to add new tasks to the list, including a task description and due date
I then Allowed users to mark tasks as complete or incomplete, updating their status accordingly.
I Provide the ability to delete tasks from the list.
I Enable users to filter tasks based on their status, such as all tasks, completed tasks, or incomplete tasks.
I Implement suitable UI controls, such as dropdowns or radio buttons, to facilitate task filtering.
I Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions or invalid user inputs gracefully.
Lastly i Displayed informative error messages to users when necessary.
